Other comments:
In my own opinion, the whole project looks great - well commenting, good classes, and animating.  
Based on the whole assignment, there is some redundant code you may have already noticed, in the 
GCircle the method "drawoutline" will not be used; thus I did not put this in the render method. 
But I kept them rather than deleted since I may use them in one day. 
By comparing with 2nd assigment, this assgiemnt changed the size of showing windows which is 1000 width and 1000 hight.
Second, in order to control the train wheel rotating, I seprate it from GTrain class.
Third, in this assigment, there are 6 animated objects: Train, Sun, clouds, Missile, UFO, and the windmill. 
Three of them are new added objects. The animation video is contained in this zip file.
Also, there are some dummy data in parameter in order to fit and not change the original method constructors. 
I would say the whole drawing is great, which looks really similar to the given picture. 
The 98% of the total scores will be given by myself if there are no other big issues.
